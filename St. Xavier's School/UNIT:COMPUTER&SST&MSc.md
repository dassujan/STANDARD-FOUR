# Social Studies: A Good Citizen (unit)

## Section 1: What Is Civics?

**Explanation:**  
- **Civics** is the study of how a government works. It explains not only the way our government runs the country, but also shows us our rights and duties as people.  
- It teaches about:  
  - How the government functions.  
  - What is expected from the government.  
  - What responsibilities every person (citizen) must follow.  
  - Our rights as part of the country.

**Remember:**  
When you follow rules like throwing rubbish in a dustbin, wearing a seat belt, or writing on paper (and not on walls), you are showing responsibility. This is one small way of learning civics.

## Section 2: Who Is a Citizen?

**Explanation:**  
- A **citizen** is someone who belongs to a country.  
- When you are born in a country, you become a citizen by birth.  
- Some people may also change their citizenship later by following the rules.  
- In some countries like Australia, Denmark, and Finland, a person may have citizenship from more than one country.

**Remember:**  
Every person who is born in their country is automatically a citizen, but it’s important to follow the rules of the country to continue enjoying the rights and responsibilities.

## Section 3: What Is Civic Sense?

**Explanation:**  
- **Civic Sense** combines two words:  
  - **Civic** means relating to a city or town (this tells us about our responsibilities in the place where we live).  
  - **Sense** means being aware of something.  
- **Civic Sense** is all about being aware of your rights and duties as a citizen.
- It encourages you to take good care of your surroundings, keep your city clean, and respect other people.

**Remember:**  
Having civic sense means always doing your part—like not littering and showing respect to fellow citizens and public property.

## Section 4: Being a Good Neighbour

**Explanation:**  
- A good neighbour is someone who helps and cares about the people living close by.  
- **Good Neighbours:**  
  - Cooperate with each other.  
  - Are polite and kind.  
  - Help one another, especially in times of need.
- Being a good neighbour is the first step towards being a good citizen.

**Remember:**  
When you are a good neighbour, you create a friendly community where everyone supports one another.

## Section 5: Being a Good Citizen

**Explanation:**  
- A **good citizen** is a person who respects others and follows rules.  
- **Key points:**  
  - You obey rules and help keep the country safe and clean.  
  - You respect national symbols, like the national flag and the national anthem.  
  - You participate in the running of the country—this means voting in elections when you are 18 years or older.
- By doing your part, like paying taxes and caring for public places, you show love and respect for your country.

**Remember:**  
Every small responsible act, like throwing trash in a dustbin or respecting public property, is important. Together they help run the country better.

## Section 6: Public and Private Property

**Explanation:**  
- **Public Property:**  
  - These are places and things built and maintained by the government for everyone.  
  - Examples include schools, hospitals, roads, parks, museums, monuments, and public transport.  
  - The money from taxes is used to take care of public property.
- **Private Property:**  
  - These are things owned by a person or family, like your house, vehicles, books, or furniture.
- **Your Responsibility:**  
  - Do not throw rubbish on roads, in parks, or on historical monuments.  
  - Do not scribble on walls or damage things in public transport or schools.  
  - Always use both public and private property wisely and with care.

**Remember:**  
Taking care of public and private property means you are not only respecting the place where you live but also helping everyone around you enjoy safe, well-maintained spaces.

## Section 7: Elections and Voting

- Elections are a process where citizens choose their leaders.
- Every citizen aged 18 years and above has the right and responsibility to vote.
