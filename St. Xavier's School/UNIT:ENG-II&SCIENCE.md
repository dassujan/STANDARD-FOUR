# SCIENCE: HUMAN BODY-THE DIGESTIVE AND EXCRETORY SYSTEMS

### Digestive System

1. **What is digestion?**  
   *Answer:*  
   Digestion is the process of breaking down food into simpler forms so that our body can use the nutrients.  
   *(The process of breaking down of food into simpler form is called digestion.)*

2. **Name the organs of the digestive system (alimentary canal).**  
   *Answer:*  
   The digestive system includes the mouth, food pipe (oesophagus), stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.  
   *(Mouth, food pipe, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus are the organs of the alimentary canal.)*

3. **What is the role of the mouth in digestion?**  
   *Answer:*  
   In the mouth, food is bitten, chewed, and mixed with saliva. Saliva makes the food soft and begins the digestion of carbohydrates.  
   *(When we take food into mouth, our teeth help to bite, chew and grind the food. Food is also mixed with saliva which helps to digest carbohydrates.)*

4. **How does food travel from the mouth to the stomach?**  
   *Answer:*  
   After chewing, food passes into the food pipe (oesophagus), where muscles push the food down to the stomach.  
   *(The food passes into the food pipe. The muscles of the food pipe push the food down into the stomach.)*

5. **What happens in the stomach during digestion?**  
   *Answer:*  
   In the stomach, food mixes with acid and enzymes. This turns the solid food into a thick liquid and starts the digestion of proteins.  
   *(Food stays in stomach for two to four hours. It gets mixed with enzymes and acid, which changes the solid food into a thick liquid. Digestion of proteins begins in the stomach.)*

6. **How does the small intestine help in digestion?**  
   *Answer:*  
   In the small intestine, the food is mixed with juices from the liver and pancreas. This is where complete digestion and absorption of food occurs.  
   *(In the small intestine, food gets mixed with digestive juices from the liver and pancreas, and nutrients are absorbed through the walls.)*

7. **What is the role of the large intestine, rectum, and anus?**  
   *Answer:*  
   The large intestine absorbs water from the leftover waste. The rectum stores this undigested food as faeces, and the anus is the opening through which faeces leave the body.  
   *(The large intestine absorbs water from the leftover waste; the rectum stores undigested food in the form of faeces, and the anus discharges the faeces.)*

8. **Why is proper chewing of food necessary?**  
   *Answer:*  
   Chewing breaks food into smaller pieces, releases saliva (which aids in digestion), and makes it easier for food to move through the food pipe.  
   *(Chewing helps in breaking down food into smaller pieces, releases saliva that helps digest carbohydrates, and makes swallowing easier.)*

9. **What are the roles of the liver and pancreas in digestion?**  
   *Answer:*  
   The liver produces bile that helps in breaking down fats, and the pancreas produces digestive juices with enzymes that help digest food.  
   *(Liver secretes bile which helps in the breakdown of fats. Pancreas secretes digestive juices containing enzymes that help in digestion.)*


### Excretory System

10. **What is the excretory system and why is it important?**  
    *Answer:*  
    The excretory system removes waste products and extra water from our body, keeping it clean and healthy.  
    *(The process of removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.)*

11. **Name the main organs of the urinary system.**  
    *Answer:*  
    The urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra.  
    *(Urinary system is the main excretory system that removes wastes in the form of urine, and it includes the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra.)*

12. **What is the function of the kidneys?**  
    *Answer:*  
    Kidneys filter the blood and remove waste products, which then form urine.  
    *(Kidneys are the main organs of the excretory system that filter the blood and pass waste as urine.)*

13. **How do the ureters work?**  
    *Answer:*  
    Ureters are tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.  
    *(They are muscular tubes that connect the kidneys to the urinary bladder, carrying urine.)*

14. **What does the urinary bladder do?**  
    *Answer:*  
    The urinary bladder stores urine until it is ready to leave the body.  
    *(It is a hollow muscular organ that stores urine before it is passed out of the body.)*

15. **How is urine expelled from the body?**  
    *Answer:*  
    Urine is passed out of the body through the urethra.  
    *(The urethra is a duct which conveys urine out of the body from the urinary bladder.)*


### Healthy Habits for Digestion and Excretion

16. **What are some healthy habits to keep the digestive and excretory systems healthy?**  
    *Answer:*  
    - Wash your hands before and after meals.  
    - Eat meals at a fixed time every day.  
    - Chew food properly.  
    - Eat a balanced diet with all necessary nutrients.  
    - Avoid talking while eating and do not overeat.  
    - Avoid drinking water during meals.  
    - Rinse your mouth after eating.  
    - Do not play or sleep immediately after eating.  
    - Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water every day.  
    *(These habits help in better digestion, absorption of nutrients, and proper removal of waste.)*

17. **Why is water important for our body?**  
    *Answer:*  
    Water helps in the absorption of nutrients, regulates body temperature, and is necessary for the proper movement of waste out of our body.  
    *(Water is important for the absorption of nutrients and helps in the removal of toxins from our body.)*
